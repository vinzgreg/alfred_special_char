## Usage

Remove special characters from Cliboard with the keyword `case`. Two results are previewed as Alfred results, one with SPACE and one with _. Select one to copy it to the clipboard and paste into in the current application.

Optionally, any text typed after `special` will be changed instead of the clipboard.
